### Preface
I will not say this out loud,\
so this is where it will be.\
Months' worth of ground,\
I shall cover shortly.

---

Trying to change my frequency.\
Trying to move from a low to a high.\
Unable to break free from this rhythmless shriek,\
That blocks every try.

The ebb and flow of social water\
does not happen to my advantage.\
Leaving the sand burning dry or giving it a mild soak,\
is about the end of its craze.

The wind of will and illuminance of intrepidity\
fluctuate as per the whims of fuck knows who.\
The dark calm brought by diffidence, dysphoria, and dichotomy,\
forever holds back the sunny winds.

Decisions bad and worse dot the days past with\
a desperation struggling to find cohesive meaning.\
All that is natural sometimes requires extreme fabrication to replicate,\
and often becomes a dot in the day.

There's constant struggle to break free from\
the shriek of yesteryears that has haunted me.\
Recently did I realize the shriek was to be ripped apart from life, but\
the battle to finally resonate still goes on.
