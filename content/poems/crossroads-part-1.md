One too many sighs to count.\
Mental solace can never be found.\
The ideal life remains to be found.\
The days pass without count.

I cannot be a good mentor.\
I've come too far skating through life.\
I've not learnt enough through life.\
Some mentors need mentors.

A ten-way intersection.\
All directions have demons at the entrance.\
The stabbing fright rips the ground away.\
The air grazes you, boiling you as you antagonize yourself.

The intersection seems like the only respite.\
Yet I cannot stay there. I don't want to stay there.\
As I turn hostile against myself, I turn to others for respite.

Only another mind can fight a self-destructing mind.\
The mind knows, though, that the other mind is not responsible for it.\
Crowding out the mind works until the crowd is not there.\
The mind knows better. It has to start doing better.

Uncertainty can be masked with bigger certainties.\
Until there are no such shields and you have to fly unguarded.\
Maneuvering and mastering the ways and route, unguarded.\
With courage to turn uncertainty to certainty.

The ten-way was supposed to be merely a state of flux.\
Yet I have been standing there for forever.\
Staring at the demons, not moving ever.\
Don’t know what to do, but I don’t want to be there till dusk.
