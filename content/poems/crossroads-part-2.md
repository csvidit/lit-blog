There it goes, crashing down.\
There it goes, crumbling into pieces.\
There it goes, clawed by my own fingers.\
And so it stands, much worse than ever before.\
And so it kneels, much harder than ever before.
And so it collapses, much weaker than ever before.

All dreams don’t come true, that’s true.\
Everything isn’t always positive, that’s positive.\
Life is not exactly smooth, is smoothly said.\
One is not without flaws, is a flawless statement.

Yet.\
The battle of the dreams and the nightmares,\
The battle of the positives and the negatives,\
The battle of the smooth and the rough,\
The battle of the qualities and the flaws,\
And the war of happiness and of sadness,\
is but being lost day by day as I tremble through, lost for words, actions, and remedies.


It hurts more, when I realize time and again that it’s all of my making.\
It hurts more, when time flies but I’m at the same place again and again.\
It hurts more, when everything and everyone start seeming like aliens.\
It hurts more, when I start losing respect and care for myself.\
It hurts more, when I find myself crying in a room full of laughter.\

It pains excruciatingly, when I lose belief in myself and all that’s good.\
It pains excruciatingly, when the anger I feel towards myself tortures my soul.\
It pains excruciatingly, when I realize I keep failing myself.\
It pains excruciatingly, when I feel like it’s too late.

The crossroads that I find myself in might never be crossed,\
For my trust, confidence, and drive have collapsed.\
The crossroads that I cannot wait to cross,\
Seem to be uncrossable.

And slowly everyone leaves the crossroads,\
Conquering themselves.\
As the snow thaws, they come out and rise,\
Ready to run.\
Yet some like me seem to stay put,\
And decay away from existence.
