Justified forebodings and a tumultuous start.\
Never had I been unhappy to be home.

Self-worth boosts and extra alertness.\
Old wounds strike harder than you expect.

Loving the journey and loathing the destination.\
Progress, however little, going to fucking hell.

Changing perspectives and changing circumstances.\
It’s tougher to reconcile with places all too familiar.

Fists ahead and a proud posture.\
Crushing the domain to adapt it for now.

Feelings of stagnancy and rusted personas.\
Seldom does a memory lane help with that.

Relative differences and bargained comparisons.\
Not something I like to indulge in much.\

Impending realizations and intrusive thoughts.\
Late night convulsions is not vacation.\

Changed surroundings and changed business.\
Dodging issues that mattered for very long.\

Loneliness here and loneliness there.\
An issue-in-progress for more than a year.\

Simple issues and disproportionate anxiety.\
Nothing will ever get done.

Lackluster responses and fear of disappointment.\
Tens of messages remain unanswered.

Continuous music and shaking floors.\
Crowding out idle thoughts.

Too much overdrive and then deceleration.\
Realities strike with constructive interference.

Changing clothes and thought processes.\
The need of the hour is to change myself.

Works in progress and flaws evermore.\
Hatred strikes out the nerve of nascency.

Perspectives in place and time’s meteors.\
What’s even the point anymore.

Unending comfort and idleness.\
Safe spaces are a responsibility to oneself.

No umbrellas and where to get them.\
Because the storm’s been around for long.

Lethargy and lackadaisicalness.\
The safe space’s gotten too comfortable.

Sad moments and silent times.\
Looking back, this is what it feels like.

A few people and a few moments.\
What it took for me to keep going.

Departures too many and safety too little.\
I burrowed back into my detestable shell.

No one to turn to and no HOME for respite.\
A nomad desperate to find a belonging home.

Idealistic prospects and subsequent sadness.\
Rejected acceptance of an unideal home.

A noble’s advent and moments new.\
Something unexpected and undeserved.

Amazing moments and unanticipated comfort.\
What’s real and what’s not?

Rollercoaster minds and internal screams.\
Horrible hospitality afforded to the noble.

Thoughts from there and thoughts here.\
A poem of leftovers to end a tiring year.
